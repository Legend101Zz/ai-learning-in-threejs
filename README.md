A JavaScript maze solver was built using the A* algorithm. The objective was to generate a maze and then use the A* algorithm to find the optimal path from the start to the end of the maze.

To begin, a maze generation algorithm was implemented. The Hamiltonian algorithm was used to map the nodes in the maze and create a connected graph. This algorithm ensured that the maze had no loops or isolated areas, and every node was reachable from any other node.

Next, the A* algorithm was implemented. This algorithm used a heuristic function to estimate the cost of reaching the end node from each node in the maze. The Manhattan distance was used as the heuristic function, which calculated the distance between two points as the sum of the absolute differences in their x and y coordinates.

To visualize the maze and the solver, a first-person view was created using WebGL. The code from a previous boids implementation was reused but with a path-following behavior added to the agents. This behavior enabled the agents to follow the optimal path generated by the A* algorithm.

To improve the performance of the implementation, the A* algorithm was optimized by using a priority queue to store the nodes in the maze. This ensured that the nodes with the lowest estimated cost were always explored first.

Finally, the JavaScript code was optimized using various techniques such as minification and code splitting. These techniques reduced the size of the code and improved the frame rate of the application.

Overall, this project demonstrated the power of the A* algorithm for solving maze problems and the importance of optimization techniques for improving the performance of JavaScript applications.
